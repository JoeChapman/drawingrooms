<p>I am happy to undertake commissions anywhere in the UK or Europe but do need to charge
for travel. For Drawing Room commissions I work in pencil and watercolour and the normal
size can be up to 24&#34 x 20&#34. Larger sizes can be provided if required.</p>

<p>Other media available, prices on application</p>

<p>Occasionally a room may be packed with detailed fabrics and many objects which require
more time than normal. It usually takes a day to produce a drawing and two days to
complete in colour. I am happy to take on the most complicated of briefs but reserve the
right to charge a bit more in these circumstances.</p>

<p>I prefer to work in situ rather than from photographs but will use the camera if the picture
needs to be finished in the studio.</p>

<p>These prices do not include the cost of framing, which can be provided at reasonable cost
to specification.</p>
