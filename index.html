<p>Drawing Rooms has been created to celebrate the unique and quirky passion that we English
hold for our favourite room in the house, where we relax, entertain, feel safe and show off our
treasured possessions&#46;&#46;&#46;the Drawing Room.</p>

<p>These places of calm can be photographed for posterity but the real essence and character of
a room can only be captured in a drawing or painting.</p>

<p>Whilst convalescing following an eye operation several years ago I spent a week drawing and
painting my surroundings, a delightful cottage on a shingle strand in Suffolk.
I had the time to appreciate the relationship between my host and his home and found myself
able to record the character of the rooms and the personality of the man.</p>

<p>Since then I have been fortunate enough to be commissioned to draw and paint a number of
delightful rooms in watercolour. But it doesn&#39;t stop with interiors, it could be a greenhouse or a
favourite spot in the garden, perhaps a view of the house from the bottom of the garden&#46;&#46;&#46;in
fact anywhere with sentimental value.</p>

<p>Click on <a href="drawingrooms.html">drawing rooms</a> to see some of the commissioned pictures that I have recently
produced, in places as diverse as North Norfolk, Provence, Piccadilly, Suffolk, Cornwall and
Cambridge. There are also a number of pictures in <a href="otherwork.html">other work</a> that I have painted over the
years&#46;&#46;&#46;still lives, landscapes, the odd life drawing. All are for sale and can be supplied framed
if required.</p>

<p>Please enjoy browsing and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
